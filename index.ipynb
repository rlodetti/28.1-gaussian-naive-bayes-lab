    "As discussed, the point estimate from the probability density function is not a true probability measurement. Recall that the area under a probability density function is 1, representing the total probability of all possible outcomes. Accordingly, to determine the probability of a feature measurement occurring, you would need to find the area under some portion of the PDF. Determining appropriate bounds for this area however, is a bit tricky and arbitrary. For example, when generating a class prediction, you would want to know the probability of a patient having a resting blood pressure of 145 given that they had heart disease versus the probability of having a resting blood pressure of 145 given that the did not have heart disease. Previously, you've simply used the point where x=145 on the PDF curve to do this. However, the probability of any single point is actually 0. To calculate the actual probability, you would have to create a range around the observed value such as \"what is the probability of having a resting blood pressure between 144 and 146 inclusive?\" Alternatively, you could narrow the range and rewrite the problem as \"what is the probability of having a resting blood pressure between 144.5 and 145.5?\" Since defining these bounds is arbitrary, a potentially interesting research question is how various band methods might impact output predictions and the overall accuracy of the algorithm.\n",

For example, taking the previous example of resting blood pressure, you might calculate the probability of having a resting blood pressure within 1bp of 145 given that a patient has heart disease. In this case, the range width would be 2bp (144bp to 146bp) and the corresponding area under the PDF curve for the normal distribution would look like this:  \n",
